# Modeling-with-SVM-Decesion-trees-Random-forest
## Problem statement:
Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.
### Part 1: Decision trees:
I appliedd Random forests and implemented Ada boosted trees, and gradient boosted trees to optimize the model.


### Part 2: SVM:
 I Applied Polynomial, linear and rbf kernel function to build your SVM model and then evaluated their performance and pick the kernel that performs the best. I tunned the parameters to improve the performance of your model. 

**Dataset Columns**
* status: whether someone tests negative or positive for hypothyroid.
*	Age
*	Sex
*	on_thyroxine
*	query_on_thyroxine
*	on_antithyroid_medicationthyroid_surgery
*	query_hypothyroid
*	query_hyperthyroid
*	pregnant
*	sick
*	tumor
*	lithium:is concentrated by the thyroid and inhibits thyroidal iodine uptake. It also inhibits iodotyrosine coupling, alters thyroglobulin structure, and inhibits thyroid hormone secretion
*	goitre:a swelling of the neck resulting from enlargement of the thyroid gland.
*	TSH_measured:A TSH test is done to find out if your thyroid gland is working the way it should. ... If untreated, a thyroid disorder can cause health problems. TSH stands for “thyroid stimulating hormone” and the test measures how much of this hormone is in your blood
*	TSH
*	T3_measured
*	T3 : A T3 test is performed as part of an evaluation of thyroid function. It measures the blood level of the hormone T3 (triiodothyronine)
*	TT4_measured:This test measures the level of the hormone thyroxine (T4) in your blood. The hormone is made by your thyroid gland
*	TT4
* TBG:TBG binds thyroid hormones in circulation. It is one of three transport proteins (along with transthyretin and serum albumin) responsible for carrying the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the bloodstream.
